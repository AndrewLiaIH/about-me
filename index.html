        About me:
    </h1>
    Hello! I am Andrew Lia <img src="pfp.jpg" alt="Andrew Lia">, a 16 years old, and a first year Information Technology student (group A) at InHolland University of Applied Sciences in Haarlem, NL.
    <div>
        I chose Information Technology because I greatly enjoy solving problems and finding the most efficient, effective, and overall "best" way to do something.

        At the top of my interests lists resides music (specifically the piano, which I have played for 10 years), a new enjoyment of biking, and the highly satifactory process of understanding.

    <p style="background-color:#f3431d;"> Also, my favorite color is orange!
